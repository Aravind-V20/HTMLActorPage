  Ravi was born in Delhi on 3 March 1926. He had no formal training in classical music; instead he learned music by listening to his father sing bhajans. In 1947 he went meet the famous singer Mohammed Rafi who was singing at the independence day celebration event ‘Jashn e Jamhooriat’ at the Coronation Hotel, Fatehpur, Delhi. He told Rafi that he wanted to be music director. According to Ravi, Mohammed Rafi advised him to first learn music and notation.[4] He taught himself to play harmonium and other classical instruments and worked as an electrician at the Post and Telegraph, Delhi,[5] to support his family. In 1950, he decided to shift to Bombay and become a professional singer. At first Ravi was homeless, living on the streets and sleeping on Malad railway station at night. Later, he lived in a tin house before he became a success story.
